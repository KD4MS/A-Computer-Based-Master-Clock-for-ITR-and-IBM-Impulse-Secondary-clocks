# A-Computer-Based-Master-Clock-for-ITR-and-IBM-Impulse-Secondary-clocks
Electronic Master:
This article describes how IBM's time control system works and discusses three different versions of a computerized equivalent master clock. A master is needed to accurately operate one or a hundred IBM minute impulse self-regulating secondary movements as timepieces.  The electronic masters detailed here control three-wire self-correcting minute impulse secondaries (notice no second hand).   
So if you are lacking a functional master, build one of the versions of this project and get your IBM
impulse secondary working accurately and electronically without ruining your pocket book.
